### Day 0: 2024-05-27 Monday (Spring Bank Holiday in UK)

**Today's Progress**: Today compeleted Days 12 and Day 13 of "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy. I also got distracted perhaps by discovering [CodIngame](https://www.codingame.com/)

**Thoughts:** I worked fast through this and there are things to be improved on the blackjack game, however I wanted to proceed regardless as was excited to see what Day 14 had to offer.

### Day 2: 2024-05-29 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: COMPLETED DAY 15 & DAY 16
04:30 BST - 3rd morning now, actually had to push myself to get out of bed at 4.30am. But Iâ€™m here for another 3 hour focused deep work session programming.

06:11 BST - and I've just finished Day 15 Coffee Machine.

09:00 BST - I've been at it since 4.30AM. Got to the last bit of Day 16, which is to code the coffee machine but using #OOP
I think I will leave it for next morning to start it afresh, and allow my mind to enter diffuse mode

16:51 BST - So got on with my day after stopping work at 9am. Yet then as Professor Barbara Oakley taught us, my mind worked through the problem, so when I returned home after chores, shopping, father duties, etc. I came straight back to Day 16 OOP problem and solved it to perfection!

**Thoughts** I am writing this in hindsight, from 2024-06-07 Friday, and I can't find my Day 15 Coffee Machine project. I know I completed it, I remember doing the work and seeing it run beautifully, yet I can't find it anywhere, on my Replit, VSCode or PyCharm.

### Day 3: 2024-05-30 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 17 and half way through Day 18

07:17 BST - Just finished Day 17. I must say, I didn't expect it to take so long, but boy am I loving #OOP in #Python. @yu_angela managed to get me to understand OOP through doing it. Her teaching methods are by far the best I've come across!

09:00 BST - Stopped halfway through Day 18 of #100DaysOfCode #AngelaYu #Udemy #Python. Being introduced to Turtle graphics, packages, modules, etc.

**Thoughts** Dr Angela Yu deserves the recognition she gets, her courses on Udemy are the best and her methods are the best, to take you from beginner to being able to proudly call yourself a professional programmer. I love Object-Orientated-Programming and I am enjoying the fact that I've started working on GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces) in Python. I can't wait to go back to my older projects that are all text-based and give them all GUIs.

### Day 10: 2024-06-06 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

05:10 BST - I was awake in bed before 4.30am, but didn't get out until I heard the alarm. Hayfever has come down on me very hard since yesterday and plagued me since then till now. So my eyes are constantly filled with tears, my nose is runny and my breathing is hampered a little. Yet, I still get that exciting feeling when I boot up PyCharm IDE to get started.
05:44 BST - Completed Day 24 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, by Angela Yu of AppBrewery on Udemy

06:11 BST - Day 25 is to learn how to use Pandas and make something like this https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states

08:22 BST - Finished work learning how to manipulate squirrel data

09:00 BST - Stopped work, I didn't start the final task of Day 25 which is the US States Game. So instead I just went through Days 2, 3 and 4 of the Replit 100 Days of Code challenge @ https://join.replit.com/python

**Thoughts** I am very very excited about working with Python Panda and venturing into the world of Data Science. 
Apart from that, I realised I have not been as productive and efficiently focused on my work in recent mornings. I realised this morning that I did not take any breaks. This hampered my progress as over time I was going through things more slowly and getting stuck on things that I perhaps could have overcome better after a short break to refresh myself and have a look at my coding again with fresh eyes.
So I intend to make sure I try to prime myself the morning before, by having a bit more of a plan on how I will spend my mornings, rather than just wake up and get started and work it out as I go along. I think I need to force myself to have 5 minute breaks after each 30min session. As well as to have a brief look over the work I am expected to do also.

**Notes** 1. Read Donald Knuth book "The Art of Computer Programming" - Angela says to focus on readability and make it easy for fellow coders to understand, rather than efficiency at the start.

### Day 11: 2024-06-07 Friday 

**Today's Progress**: 

04:00 BST woke up nice.

04:30 BST started work on the US States Game, from Day 25 of Angela Yu's Python course on Udemy. I ensured I had a break after about 30min intervals.

07:30 BST Completed Day 25! See links below to see work.

08:38 BST Got distracted in a break. Found this cool site called [profileme.dev](https://www.profileme.dev/) from a guy called Daniel Cranney on [Twitter](https://x.com/danielcranney). I've used it for myself and you can see the results at my own [profile](https://github.com/ZuIs84). It's okay, I usually stop working at 9am. Instead, I'm going to give myself a 30mins break and then charge on for extra time into 10am to get Day 26 complete.

14:55 BST LESSON 32 DAY 26 - DICTIONARY COMPREHENSION 2, this was hard! I couldn't work it out after spending ages on it, then leaving it and coming back. This one I feel was made too difficult, so I skipped ahead to see the answer. Even then it took a while for me to work out what was going on in the code. Anyway, onwards to the final task of DAY 26

15:02 BST - I realise now why LESSON 32 DAY 26 - DICTIONARY COMPREHENSION 2 was soo hard! There was a video explaining how to use Dicitionary Comprehension that I missed, so I'm now quite impressed with myself, as I did LESSON 31 DAY 26 - DICTIONARY COMPREHENSION 1 without watching that video.



**Thoughts:** I worked fast through this and there are things to be improved on the blackjack game, however I wanted to proceed regardless as was excited to see what Day 14 had to offer.
I realise I should look to how to extend each program that I complete during this challenge. So for instance, after completing this US States Game, I could easily create one for the oceans and continents of the world, then the same for any map I can get my hands on. I would like to create one for all the counties of UK.

Found out why I was not able to make executable files with pyinstaller. I ran into this when trying to make one from the update snake_game which now has a high score feature. The answer was found here : [click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70227771/i-cant-use-pyinstaller). "python -m PyInstaller --onefile rename.py"
Replace rename.py with the actual name and path of your Python script. This command invokes PyInstaller as a module directly using Python, which should work even if PyInstaller's directory is not in the PATH.

But now I have a new problem, the exe. file crashes. This could be due to file handling, which the previous snake and pong games did not have.

### Day 12: 2024-06-08 Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: COMPLETED DAY 26 - NATO ALPHABET

07:00 BST - My phone was dead, so no alarm. This was the first morning I didn't jump out of bed as soon as my eyes opened. 

10:48 BST - omg... this was the hardest task by far since starting. I've completed it! After this, I'm taking a break, need to spend time with the family.

19:30 BST - back on it, starting DAY 27, which is working with tkinter and GUIs, exciting stuff! 

21:41 BST - I'm right at the end of DAY 27, which is The Miles to Kilometers Converter project. I've squeezed in a lot of work today and it's late, so I am going to save this for tomorrow morning. It shouldn't take long, so I am excited what DAY 28 will bring.


**Thoughts:** I think I burned myself out yesterday. I've also started to use a stand for my laptop, as I've been suffering excruciating back pain due to poor posture and spending hours on end on my laptop. I've only had a laptop for about a year, before which I always worked at a desk with a PC, so never really suffered from such things before.
Angela Yu mentioned a film that I intend to watch soon sometime called [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) Basically how this Xerox lab in Palo Alto created the very first GUI, Apple stole the idea, then blamed Microsoft for stealing it from them, but Microsoft reminded them they both took it from Palo Alto.

### Day 13: 2024-06-09 Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: COMPLETED DAY 27 "Miles to KM Converter"

08:57 BST - Had a very late night and so woke late. Today's going to be a very busy day so not sure if I will get much work done.

09:22 BST - Finished DAY 27! 


**Thoughts:** Day 27 was way easier than Day 26.

### Day 14: 2024-06-10 Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Some work, but nothing completed.

14:28 BST - Working from my car remotely. Began working on old HyperionDev/CoGrammer bootcamp projects and making GUI versions of them.
15:00 BST - had to stop and get on with day.

20:39 BST - Back on it.
21:12 BST - I'm too exhausted. I've gotten stuch on how when I used get() to retrieve inputted values from my entry boxes, I am not able to cast them into integers or floats, without an error that tells me can't convert the strings. I hope to sleep early tonight and wake up early again so I can work to figure this out, and also start on Day 28 work.

### Day 18: 2024-06-14 Friday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed DAy 29 - Password Generator App & completed Day 30 - Error Handling


**Thoughts:** I've had to take care of a very unwell member of my family, hence why my pace has been hampered and I've struggled to go to bed early, sleep well and wake up at 4.30am. So to kinda make up for it, I'm trying to do an all-nighter to catch up. Oh and I've also been suffering for two weeks from what appears to be a rhomboid injury, an area of muscle in the middle upper back, on the right side, which gets painful whenever I use my right arm or hand for anything.

### Day 19: 2024-06-23 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 31 - Flash Card App


**Thoughts:** I've realised that I need to revise using Pandas already. I had to look up how to import a csv, had to look up what dataframes are and how to convert to dictionary, and also need to revise dictionary comprehension too.
Learnt about a new thing where instead of using time.sleep finction, we use a tkinter: window.after(3000, func=flip_card)

This FlashCard App I will to adjust so that it clones Anki as much as possible. Then I can create my own version of Anki that ports to web and mobile.

### Day 20: 2024-06-24 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 32 - Birthday Wisher using SMTP


**Thoughts:** This is soo cool, but now I guess I know how junk/spam mail works. I'm already having ideas of how to generate email lists, to email newsletters, to email my resume to prospective employers and clients etc.
I need to do more exercices on list comprehension, dictionary comprehension and working with Pandas dataframes. This is a big weakness for me I feel and I think I need to find somewhere else to supplement my going through Angela Yu's course to remedy this deficiency 



### Day 21: 2024-06-25 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed going through Mariya Sha's videos.


**Thoughts:** Today it's 28 degrees! Here in Hampshire, England. Right, so I wasn't happy with how yesterday went, I felt unsatisfied with my lack of clarity on how dictionary comprehension works. So today I decided to find some other tutorials online focused no this. Thankfully I found Mariya Sha's tutorials which I spent today going through. You can find her on GitHub : https://github.com/MariyaSha
